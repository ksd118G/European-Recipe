        <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion and garlic, saut√© until softened.</li>
            <li>Add sliced mushrooms to the pan and cook until they release their moisture and become golden brown.</li>
            <li>Stir in Arborio rice and cook for 2-3 minutes until the rice is lightly toasted.</li>
            <li>Pour in the white wine and cook until it is mostly absorbed by the rice.</li>
