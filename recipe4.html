        <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 200째F (95째C) to keep the cooked items warm while frying.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cold water, salt, and pepper to make the batter.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a large, deep pan to 375째F (190째C).</li>
            <li>Dip the fish fillets into the batter, allowing excess to drip off, and carefully place them in the hot oil. Fry until golden brown and crispy (about 5-7 minutes per side).</li>
            <li>While the fish is frying, cook the potato strips in batches until golden and crispy (about 4-6 minutes per batch).</li>
            <li>Remove the fish and chips from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
            <li>Keep the cooked fish and chips warm in the preheated oven while frying the remaining batches.</li>
            <li>Serve the Fish and Chips hot with lemon wedges and your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
